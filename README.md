Jade
====

A [Ghost](http://github.com/tryghost/ghost/) theme loosely based on a [Website](https://github.com/hxkclan/hxkclan.github.io) i made earlier. It's basically a sort of a 'card' look. 

Jade uses the following libraries;

- Bootstrap
- jQuery

#Preview
This theme is currently under (heavy) development. So it changes, stuff gets added etc. The master branch usually has a version that is at least usable.

#Use
- Download the package
- Place the jade theme folder inside your 'content/theme' folder
- Restart your Ghost instance to see the new theme and apply it.
