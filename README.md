Jade
====

A [Ghost](http://github.com/tryghost/ghost/) theme loosely based on a [Website](https://github.com/hxkclan/hxkclan.github.io) i made earlier.

#Design & features
- Posts can be expanded and retracted so there's no 'navigation' required.
- Loosely based on [Material Design principles](http://www.google.com/design/spec/what-is-material/environment.html); so simple, no fuss, it just works.
- No header image - it's just plain and simple

#Stuff used
Jade uses the following libraries;
- [Bootstrap](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap)
- [jQuery](https://github.com/jquery/jquery) (included within Ghost)
- [Readmore.js](https://github.com/jedfoster/Readmore.js)

#Preview
This theme is currently under (heavy) development. So it changes, stuff gets added etc. The master branch usually has a version that is at least usable.
